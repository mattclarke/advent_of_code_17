## Day 1
- Part 1: looping but don't forget to check the last value.
- Part 2: modulo to find the element halfway round.

## Day 2
- Part 1: find the max and min for each row of data.
- Part 2: for each value in a row, look for when modulo is zero with any other value in the row.

## Day 3
- Part 1: simple to brute force, but did it with maths for a bit of fun.
- Part 2: brute force.

## Day 4
- Part 1: put the list of words in a set and see if both are the same length.
- Part 2: first sort the letters of each word and then create the set.

## Day 5
- Part 1: simple looping.
- Part 2: similar but with decrement for >= 3. Takes ~10 secs with Python, < 1 second with PyPy.

## Day 6
- Part 1: simple looping.
- Part 2: essentially the same code with some extra book-keeping to keep track of the target.
